# Algorithm Analysis

##### Algorithm
An algorithm is a type of effective method in which a definite list of well-defined instructions for completing a task, when given an initial state, will proceed through a well-defined series of successive states, eventually terminating in an end-state.

##### Characteristics of an Algorithm
* Input - zero or more
* Output - at least one
* Definiteness - clear and unambigious
* Finiteness - terminates after finite steps
* Effectiveness - basic steps which are feasible
